for bug reports and feature suggestions, go to the github page:
https://github.com/CrazyAmphibian/Alwayscast

What this does:
changes all greek-letter spells and add trigger/timer/on death spells to consume mana on all spells they cast.
Additionally, some greek letter spells no longer alter the wand's recharge or cast delay

Why?
these spells are too powerful for the game to have any reasonable expectation of balance. This changes that.

Notice on compatibility: this mod completely overwrites the code of the spells it touches. If this causes a conflict, load this mod such that it runs first."
