for bug reports and feature suggestions, go to the github page:
https://github.com/CrazyAmphibian/Alwayscast

What this does:
* changes all greek-letter spells and add trigger/timer/on death spells to consume mana on all spells they cast.
* Additionally, some greek letter spells no longer alter the wand's recharge or cast delay
* makes some more spells unlimited
* circle of vigor now requires you stand in it
* tweaks the mana costs of some spells.

Why?
some spells are never used (looking at you, myriad spell), and some are too powerful for the game to have any expectation of balance (any greek spell)

Notice on compatibility: this mod completely overwrites the code of the spells it touches. If this causes a conflict, load this mod such that it runs first."
